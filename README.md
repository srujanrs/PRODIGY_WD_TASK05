I have sucessfully completed building an Weather App web application. This application allows user to track the weather report of 
any part of the world user has to type the city name and then with the click on "click me" button user can see all key weather
report like:Temperature,RainIntensity,Wind-speed,SnowIntensity,Humidity,Clouds.
